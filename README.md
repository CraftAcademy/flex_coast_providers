# Flex Coast API
Welcome to the Admin Client repo of March 2021 cohort's final project.  

## Final Project March 2021
We have built a fullstack platform for new office leasing startup in Gothenburg that spans 3 different applications:  

1. A client for customers that are seeking to rent a new office in Gothenburg. It is a single page application that contains cosy inteface with general information about the company, and a wizard, with which customer can create an inquiry to broker to search for a new office.

2. An admin interface for brokers where they have access to all inquiries, can administer them and have access to statistics

3. A backend engine that stores all of our data and provides end-points to access it

## The Admin Client code   
**The Admin site for Flex coast provides a simple Customer Relationship Managment system (or CRM).**  

Here the Brokers are able to see an overview of all inquiries split in to individual rows. Each row is expandable and contains more detailed information, options to update the current status, a log book containing notes and important events in an inquiry's life cycle and the ability to export the inquiry to a more fully fledged CRM on Hubspot. 

The analytics page provides an overview of site statistics and analytics. All this is built with React JS to provide smooth interaction and seamless interactivity.
